# Neural Networks for Blockly Games Gallery

This is a project to tackle the 160,000 submission backlog in Blockly Games Turtle.

## Presentation NNDL.pptx

Power Point presentation given at ZHAW on 27 May 2025.

## Pool

This directory contains a selection of diverse user-created images.  Some of these are published, some are offensive, others are boring.  No two images are overly similar to each other.

## isotope.py

This script creates the Training, Validation, and Testing directories.  It then distributes the Pool images across these directories, and generates the isotopes of each image.

## Convolutional

A convolutional network that performs very poorly.

## Siamese

A Siamese ResNet network that performs with 95% accuracy.  Trains in 150 epochs.

## Dino

A Siamese DINO network that performs with 95% accuracy.  Trains in 2000 epochs.
